Problem Statement
You have to create a python script to find out the colour of the traffic signal passed as an image
The trafic signal will always be in a form of blue rectangle having three circle with their respective colour (red,blue,green) or white (white represents off)
outside the blue rectange there can be any shape with any colour except a blue rectange.
Your function must take an image as an input and return a string as output with 4 possible values i.e "RED","YELLOW","GREEN","ERROR"
Your can assume the colors for cours used for tarfic signal are constant and wont change (you can find out their values)
